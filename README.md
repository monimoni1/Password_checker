# Password_checker
A little password checking project I made. Objective and roadblocks I encountered on this project will be detailed below. 

## NOTES:
1- Since I am using someone else's laptop, the git commit might look like it's from someone else, but I did all the commits, albeit from a shared system.
2- The '''git push''' command initially didn't work for me. FYI: I am using MacOS 64x intel chip. I also have zsh as my powershell and needed to install Homebrew. I followed this answer on [Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74259142/26556323) This helped install Homebrew. And then I followed [the prompts given in this Github page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git#git-credential-manager:~:text=auth%20login.-,Git%20Credential%20Manager,-Git%20Credential%20Manager) to do the rest of it. 
3- A window should open up prompting you to enter your username and password. This worked out perfectly 
4- While executing '''gh''' prompts in your terminal make sure to keep the directory in the folder which you created to house the files you want to commit to git.
